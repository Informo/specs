The Informo core team represents the group of people that are in charge of
maintaining the current specification, the informo.network infrastructure and
most of the tools used around the Matrix protocol to make Informo possible. This
team is made of people that either founded the project, or have been deemed,
through their contributions to either the documentation, tools or discussions in
Informo's public channels, trustworthy enough to be granted this kind of
responsibilities by the rest of the team members.

The Informo core team also acts as a [trust authority]({{<ref
"/trust-management/trust-authority">}}), which mission is to asserts the
trustworthiness of other trust authorities. It also administrates a Matrix room
acting as the official informo.network federation, in which its trust authority
is included in the room's suggested trust authorities.
