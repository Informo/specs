One of Informo's key issues is to allow as much information as possible through the federated network, with some level of mitigation against intentional disinformation or propaganda. The set of mechanisms used to address this is called "trust management" in this documentation.

In order not to prevent the network to act as a censorship machine, Informo has to keep trust management optional, meaning it **must** let everyone publish information through the network and let everyone read all of the information that has been published through the network (i.e. without blocking access to anything or including any sort of strong filtering based on parameters the user doesn't control). With this in mind, trust management **must** be a process that ends up giving the user only an indication on whether a news item might be trustworthy or not, letting them make their own choice on whether or not bypass this indication.

This section describes how Informo's trust management mechanisms must work with all the related parties involved.
