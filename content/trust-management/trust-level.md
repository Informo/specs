A trust authority **should** declare its own trust level. One TA's trust level is the depth in the trust management chain which trustworthiness is asserted by this TA.

A trust authority's trust level is to be understood as follows:

* A trust level of 0 means that all of the sources certified by this trust authority as trustworthy **must** be considered as trustworthy according to this TA.
* A trust level of 1 means that both the sources and the trust authorities certified by this trust authority as trustworthy **must** be considered as trustworthy according to this TA (which means all of the trust authorities trusted by this TA **must** be considered as if their own trust level was 0).
* A trust level of 2 means that all of the sources this TA certifies to be trustworthy **must** be considered as trustworthy according to this TA, and all of the trust authorities this TA certifies as trustworthy **must** be considered as if their own trust level was 1.
* *Et cetera*...

The default trust level is 1 ðŸ‘€. A client **might** allow its users to force the trust level of each trust authority to give them more control over the articles and sources defined as trustworthy.

If a user chooses to trust a trust authority, and then to trust another trust authority that's already trusted by the first TA, the second TA's declared trust level (or 1 if there is no declared trust level for this TA) **must** takes precedence over the trust level that was assumed from the first TA's trust level.


## Example

Let's consider the example below.

```text
                          ACME.org (TA)
      -------->        Trusted by Informo        -----> JohnDoeNews.org (Source)
      |                Level 0 (assumed 0)         |    Trusted by ACME.org
      |                                            |
Informo (TA)                                       +--> SomeGuyNews.org (Source)
Level 1                                                 Trusted by ACME.org
      |
      |                Reporters.org (TA)
      -------->        Trusted by Informo        -----> SomeCountryNews.org (Source)
                       Level 1 (assumed 0)         |    Trusted by Reporters.org
                                                   |
                                                   +xx> SomeNGO.org (TA)             xxxxx> ...
                                                        Trusted by Reporters.org
                                                        Level 1

--> trusted
xx> not trusted

(TA): Trust authority
(Source): Information source
```

Here, the user chooses to trust the *Informo* trust authority, which has a trust level of 1. This means that *ACME.org* and *Reporters.org*, which are two trust authorities trusted by *Informo*, are to be trusted too, along with the sources they trust themselves. *SomeNGO.org*, along with all of the sources and trust authorities it certifies as trustworthy, is not to be trusted as *Informo*'s trust level makes it too far in the trust management chain. However, if the user chooses to trust *Reporters.org* by itself (on top of trusting *Informo*), *Reporters.org*'s initial trust level (which is 1) takes precedence, which means that *SomeNGO.org* and all of the sources and trust authorities it certifies as trustworthy are to be considered as such.
