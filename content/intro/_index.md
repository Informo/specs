Welcome to Informo's specifications. This documentation aims at giving the world a complete understanding of Informo's inner mechanisms, how it works and interacts with external elements in order to fulfill its mission. Informo needs to be as open and collaborative as possible for people to get involved, thus for it to work, therefore this documentation is also open and collaborative, which means that anyone can submit changes requests by following the [specifications change submission protocol] üìù. Any people wishing to get involved in any part of Informo, whether it is working on the specifications, contributing to the software we built for it, translations, or any other possible form of contribution (including taking part in the ongoing chatter about how to improve Informo), is more than welcome on our [Matrix discussions room](https://matrix.to/#/!LppXGlMuWgaYNuljUr:weu.informo.network) or on our [IRC channel] üìù.

## What is Informo

**TL;DR**: Informo is a decentralised and federated network that enables people to share information and to bypass corporate or state censorship at some level.

### Bypassing censorship of information done differently

This section describes how most of other solutions used to bypass censorship of information work, and how identifying their shortcomings lead to start building Informo.

To describe the way most existing solutions work, let's consider [alice](https://github.com/NInfolab/alice) as an example, which is the censorship bypass solution currently in use by [Reporters Without Borders](https://rsf.org/en/) as part of their [Collateral Freedom](https://rsf.org/en/collateral-freedom) operation, and is representative of how most solutions work üëÄ.

*alice* is basically a proxy/mirror that works by forwarding requests to a given website, and streams the data it receives back to the user üëÄ. This means that it needs to be "manually" set up on a server and configured with the websites to be proxy'd in order to work. To ensure availability, Reporters Without Borders hosts *alice* behind a CDN (*Content Delivery Network*), usually [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) or [Amazon's Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/cloudfront/). While these big players are usually considered a threat for privacy, they are also very popular and many websites and services depend on them. Blocking access to them would mean disrupting all of those services and damaging local businesses.

The address for each proxy is then both sent out to activists in the field and added to the list of proxies in the [RSF Censorship Detector browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rsf-censorship-detector/). This list is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/RSF-RWB/collateralfreedom/blob/master/sites.json) (for the same reason as the use of Fastly or Cloudfront), and downloaded by the extension at each start of the browser.

While it's an amazing solution to bypass state censorship, it comes with a few drawbacks. First, the administrators need to build an exhaustive list of the news sources that can be proxy'd. This can be considered a minor issue since the NGO (*Non-Governmental Organisation*) managing it is focused on the freedom of the press, but it still implies giving absolute trust to the said organization. Second, while blocking either Fastly or Cloudfront by a state is quite difficult, it is still possible for them to block each single sub-domain individually. In such an event, the administrators working on the Collateral Freedom operation would have to change the proxies' addresses to new ones and make them known to the relevant people by repeating the process described above.

### Bypassing censorship of information: the Informo way

Informo aims at addressing the issues mentioned in the previous section, by considering the problem of censorship of information with a different angle. It uses a federated network of servers talking with each other using the [Matrix protocol](https://matrix.org/). A federation refers to a non-fixed set of parties that can talk to all of the others parties involved. The Matrix protocol defines ways to build such federations (named "rooms" in the protocol's specifications), and assures that the history of all data sent through the federation is saved by all of the parties involved.

One of the key mission of Informo is to build a large network of nodes implementing the Matrix specification, spread as much as possible all around the world. This is why Informo needs to be open and collaborative, because it relies on giving people the ability to host their own node and expanding the network as much as possible. The bet behind this thinking is that, while it's relatively easy for a government or a company to block access to specific FQDN (*Fully qualified domain names*, e.g. `foo.example.com`) that will need human intervention to be renewed, it gets much more difficult when it comes to blocking access to an always-changing list of, let's say, hundreds of FQDN, knowing that the whole list must be denied access for the censorship to be effective, and that anyone in the world with sufficient technical knowledge (which Informo aims at keeping as low as possible) would be able to fire up another node and plug it to the existing network for access to be restored.

Regarding the trust issue described the first section, Informo also introduces a trust management mechanism, trying to set the balance between having to manually manage every person you trust, and having one person deciding for everyone who is trustworthy. In the current configuration, the Informo core team has slightly more privileges than other parties, since new users will be advised (but not forced) to start building their trust network by trusting Informo. While it's not an ideal situation, the Informo core team believes it is a step towards a less monolithic trust control.

### The meaning of "Informo"

"Informo" is a word which means "information" in the Esperanto language. Because Informo is all about information, and making it accessible, it was only logical that the name was centered on the word "information". Esperanto fits perfectly with Informo's philosophy and needs for openness, as it is a language designed to be universal and usable by anyone to communicate with everyone. On top of that, the word itself sounded nice to the project's authors, thus was chosen as the project's name.

### Emoji markers

Some parts of this documentation are marked with an emoji, indicating a special status that will require the attention of an Informo core team member or specifications contributor in the future. They are mostly there to remind the relevant people of works in progress, and informing readers that the said people know there's work to do here (so there's no need to open a ticket about it). These are:

* üîß (`:wrench:`) This part of the documentation is incomplete and must be completed before a milestone can be reached.
* üìù (`:memo:`) This is a reference to a non existing resource that must be added in the future.
* üëÄ (`:eyes:`) The author of this part of the documentation is aware that, although they believe the information given here to be correct, they might not get the full picture, therefore give incomplete or incorrect information, and wishes to encourage discussions around this point (TL;DR: "imho, please correct if wrong").
* üïê (`:clock1:`) This part of the documentation is only here temporarily for clarity purposes, and will be removed in a fixed point in the future.
* 2Ô∏è‚É£ (`:two:`) This part of the documentation is incomplete, however the rest of it is to be added only uring phase 2 of the specifications' development.

### Specifications development üïê

This part will be removed once a complete version of this documentation has been reached.

The Informo specifications' development will take place in two phases:

* **phase 1** is building the overall documentation architecture. It focuses on getting the general outlines of the project written down, with the aim of getting it out as soon as possible so people can have a less vague idea of what Informo is about.
* **phase 2** is adding in-depth documentation about Informo's inner mechanisms. It focuses on writing down the technical details of Informo, with the aim of enabling a future client implementation built from it.

  While phase 1 will mainly be done by the Informo core team, everyone is welcome to get involved in phase 2 and further, either by submitting changes or taking part in the discussions taking place in the discussion channels mentioned at the top of this page.
