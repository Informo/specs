The Informo core team represents the group of people that are in charge of maintaining the current specification, the informo.network infrastructure and most of the tools used around the Matrix protocol to make Informo possible. This team is made of people that either founded the project, or have been deemed, through their contributions to either the documentation, tools or discussions on Informo's public channels, trustworthy enough to be granted this kind of responsibilities by the rest of the team members.

The Informo core team also acts as a [trust authority](/trust-management/trust-authority), which mission is to asserts the trustworthiness of other trust authorities. It also administrates a Matrix room acting as the official informo.network federation, in which its trust authority is included in the room's suggested trust authorities.

Bellow is a list of the current members of the Informo core team, along with their Matrix device keys for E2E encryption.
