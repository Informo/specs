Welcome to Informo's specifications.

This documentation aims at giving the world a complete understanding of
Informo's inner mechanisms, how it works and interacts with external elements in
order to fulfil its mission. Informo needs to be as open and collaborative as
possible for people to get involved, thus for it to work.

For this reason, this documentation is also open and collaborative, which means
that anyone can submit changes requests by following the [specifications change
submission protocol](/introduction/scsp).

Any people wishing to get involved in any part of Informo, whether it is working
on the specifications, contributing to the software we build, translations, or
any other possible form of contribution (including taking part in the ongoing
chatter about how to improve Informo) is more than welcome to join our [Matrix
discussion room](https://matrix.to/#/!LppXGlMuWgaYNuljUr:weu.informo.network) or
our [IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23informo).
