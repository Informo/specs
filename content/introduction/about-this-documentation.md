This documentation is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using [Mathieu
Cornic's "learn" theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn). It is

## Key words

This documentation includes key words which represent either an obligation, and
interdiction, a possibility or a suggestion (depending on the word) directed to
implementation maintainers. They are made recognisable by their use of a bold
font style (e.g. "**must**"), and are listed below along with their meaning:

* **must**: instruction, obligation
* **should**: strong suggestion
* **might**: slight suggestion
* **can**: possibility
* **must not**: interdiction

## Emoji markers

Some parts of this documentation are marked with an emoji, indicating a special
status that will require the attention of an Informo core team member or
specifications contributor in the future. They are mostly there to remind the
relevant people of works in progress, and informing readers that the said people
know there's work to do here (so there's no need to open a ticket about it).
These are:

* üîß (`:wrench:`) This part of the documentation is incomplete and must be
completed before a milestone can be reached.
* üìù (`:memo:`) This is a reference to a non existing resource that must be
added in the future.
* üëÄ (`:eyes:`) The author of this part of the documentation is aware that,
although they believe the information given here to be correct, they might not
get the full picture, therefore give incomplete or incorrect information, and
wishes to encourage discussions around this point (TL;DR: "imho, please
correct if wrong").
* üïê (`:clock1:`) This part of the documentation is only here temporarily for
clarity purposes, and will be removed in a fixed point in the future.
* 2Ô∏è‚É£ (`:two:`) This part of the documentation is incomplete, however the rest
of it is to be added only during phase 2 of the specifications' development.

## Specifications development üïê

This part will be removed once a complete version of this documentation has been
reached.

The Informo specifications' development will take place in two phases:

* **phase 1** is building the overall documentation architecture. It focuses on
getting the general outlines of the project written down, with the aim of
getting it out as soon as possible so people can have a less vague idea of
what Informo is about.
* **phase 2** is adding in-depth documentation about Informo's inner mechanisms.
It focuses on writing down the technical details of Informo, with the aim of
enabling a future client implementation built from it.

While phase 1 will mainly be done by the Informo core team, everyone is welcome
to get involved in phase 2 and further, either by submitting changes or taking
part in the discussions taking place in the discussion channels mentioned at the
top of this page.
