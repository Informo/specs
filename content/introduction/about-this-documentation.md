This documentation is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using [Mathieu
Cornic's "learn" theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn). It is
distributed under the [GNU Free Documentation
License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html).

{{% notice info %}}
Please note that, because Informo is built around [Matrix](https://matrix.org),
it relies on some of its core features, such as rooms, room state, events, etc..
However, even though this documentation includes a few Matrix-specific examples
and references to Matrix features for the sake of clarity, it does not include
enough information on how Matrix actually works to offer a complete technical
overview of the whole system. It is therefore recommended to consider it as a
plug-in to the existing [Matrix specifications](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/)
rather than an independent documentation.

## Key words

This documentation includes key words which represent either an obligation, and
interdiction, a possibility or a suggestion (depending on the word) directed to
implementation maintainers. They are made recognisable by their use of a bold
font style (e.g. "**must**"), and are listed below along with their meaning:

* **must**: instruction, obligation
* **should**: strong suggestion
* **might**: slight suggestion
* **can**: possibility
* **must not**: interdiction

## Emoji markers

Some parts of this documentation may be marked with an emoji, indicating a
special status that will require the attention of an Informo core team member or
specifications contributor in the future. They are mostly there to remind the
relevant people of works in progress, and informing readers that the said people
know there's work to do here (so there's no need to open a ticket about it).
There shouldn't be any of these markers in a stable release of this
documentation. These markers are:

* üîß (`:wrench:`) This part of the documentation is incomplete and must be
  completed before a milestone can be reached.
* üìù (`:memo:`) This is a reference to a non existing resource that must be
  added in the future.
* üëÄ (`:eyes:`) The author of this part of the documentation is aware that,
  although they believe the information given here to be correct, they might not
  get the full picture, therefore give incomplete or incorrect information, and
  wishes to encourage discussions around this point.
* üïê (`:clock1:`) This part of the documentation is only here temporarily to
  provide some clarity on the state of the whole documentation, and will be
  removed in a fixed point in the future.
