An article is a news item published by a [source]({{<ref
"/information-distribution/source">}}) to the Matrix room. It **must** include
the item's content and title. The article **can** also include optional
properties, such as the item's author, date (in milliseconds since epoch),
original URL, description, read duration, NSFW marker, etc..

The article JSON object **must** be encapsulated in a [signed Matrix
event]({{<ref "/information-distribution/signature">}}), with its signature
generated with one of the source's keys.

If the original news item contains media, these media **should** be uploaded to
the node using [Matrix's content repository
module](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#id112).

## Matrix event `network.informo.article`

This message event **must** be sent and signed by a source Matrix user. See the
[signed Matrix event]({{<ref
"/information-distribution/signature#signed-matrix-event">}}) page for more
information.

If the sender is not a source user, the article **should** be ignored. If the
source registers itself afterwards, its previously sent articles **should**
become visible.

| `href`              | `string` |      | URL of the article's original post (in case the article was sent to Informo from an existing website).                                     |
| `short_description` | `string` |      | Short description or introduction to the article.                                                                                          |
| `author`            | `string` |      | Full name of the article's author (when a single Informo source aggregates multiple writers).                                              |
| `thumbnail`         | `string` |      | Preview image for the article. Must be a [`mxc://` URL](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#id112).                     |
| `date`              | `int`    |      | Timestamp in milliseconds of the article's publication. If not provided clients should fall back to the Matrix event's creation timestamp. |
| `content`           | `string` |  x   | Article HTML content. The HTML **must** be sanitized before being displayed in a client.                                                   |
| `custom`            | `object` |      | Additional information for custom client implementations.                                                                                  |

Additional information:

- Articles having a `date` field in the future **should** be ignored.
- The `date` field uses the same timestamps as in the Matrix protocol, i.e.
  milliseconds since epoch.
