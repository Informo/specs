An article is a news item published by a [source]({{<ref
"/information-distribution/source">}}) to the Matrix room. It **must** include
the item's content and title. The article **can** also include optional
properties, such as the item's author, date (in milliseconds since epoch),
original URL, description, read duration, NSFW marker, etc..

If the original news item contains media, these media **should** be uploaded to
the node using [Matrix's content repository
feature](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#id112).

## Matrix event `network.informo.article`

This message event **must** be sent and signed by a source (or a sub-source).
See the [signed Matrix event]({{<ref
"/information-distribution/signature#signed-matrix-event">}}) page for more
information.

If the sender is not a source or a sub-source, the article **should** be
ignored. If the source or sub-source registers itself afterwards, its previously
sent articles **should** become visible.

| `href`              | `string` |      | URL of the article's original post (in case the article was published on an existing website before being sent over Informo).              |
| `short_description` | `string` |      | Short description or introduction to the article.                                                                                          |
| `author`            | `string` |      | Full name of the article's author (in the case of the source not being a single individual).                                               |
| `thumbnail`         | `string` |      | Preview image for the article. Must be a [`mxc://` URL](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#id112).                     |
| `date`              | `int`    |      | Timestamp in milliseconds of the article's publication. If not provided clients should fall back to the Matrix event's creation timestamp. |
| `content`           | `string` |  x   | Article HTML content. The HTML **must** be sanitized before being displayed by a client implementation.                                    |

Additional information:

- Articles having a `date` property in the future **should** be ignored.
- The `date` property uses the same timestamps as in the Matrix protocol, i.e.
  milliseconds since epoch.
