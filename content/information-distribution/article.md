An article is a news item published by a [source](/information-distribution/sources) to the Matrix room. It **must** include the item's content, title, author and date, along with a cryptographic signature coming from its source, and be published on the publication name space that has been declared by its source.

If the original news item contains media, these media **should** be uploaded to the node using [Matrix's content repository module](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#id112).
