A source is an entity holding the responsibility of publishing information
through the Matrix room. Each source **must** be a registered Matrix user. A
Matrix user **must not** register more than one source.

Before publishing any information, a source **must** register itself as such on
the room. This **must** be done through the publication of a state event of the
`network.informo.source` type. The event's state key **must** be the ID of the
source's Matrix user. The content of this event **must** be provided using the
following model:

|      Parameter      |    Type    | Req. |                                                        Description                                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------- | :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`              | `string`   |  x   | Name of the source.                                                                                                      |
| `origin`            | `string`   |  x   | The company or individual maintaining this source.                                                                       |
| `langs`             | `[lang]`   |  x   | Languages of the source's publications.                                                                                  |
| `sig_algo`          | `string`   |  x   | Algorithm the source will use to cryptographically sign its articles. ðŸ”§                                                  |
| `sig_keys`          | `[string]` |  x   | Public keys the source will use to cryptographically sign its articles. ðŸ”§                                                |
| `website`           | `string`   |      | URL of the source's website, if there's one.                                                                             |
| `description`       | `string`   |      | Short description of the source and its publications.                                                                    |
| `logo`              | `string`   |      | Logo of the source. If provided, must be a [`mxc://` URL](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#id112). |
| `custom`            | `object`   |      | Additional information for custom client implementations.                                                                |

 <!-- ðŸ”§: Need to do some research on Megolm and Matrix APIs around encryption
 and key management -->

Where `lang` is an object using the following model:

|      Parameter      |    Type    | Req. |                                                                       Description                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------- | :--: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `locale`            | `string`   |  x   | Identifier of the language (and variant) in which the articles are written. **Must** be compliant with [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646).  |
| `mxid`              | `string`   |  x   | The Matrix identifier of the sub-source publishing the articles. **Can** be the current source.                                                          |

The array of `lang` objects within the source's registration **must** contain at
least one element. More information on localisation is available
[below](#localisation).

The registration event is the one being signed by [trust
authorities](/trust-management/trust-authority). Each time one of the source's
properties changes, a new registration event **must** be published, and a new
signature **must** be generated by each of the trust authorities certifying the
trustworthiness of this source.

## Compromission of cryptographic private keys

A source **must** be trusted by trust authorities operated by organisms it
trusts and is in contact with outside of Informo. If at least one of a source's
private keys gets compromised, the source **must** update its list of public
signature verification keys, and every trust authority trusting the source
**must** compute and issue a new signature taking the updated list of keys into
account. The reason behind this is to encourage trust authorities to communicate
with their trusted sources, estimate how much compromised the source is (i.e.
one key vs all of the keys vs the source's entire Matrix account), and take the
actions it deems necessary.

In such an event, client implementations **should** consider articles posted
prior to the key being declared as compromised as possibly, but not surely
trustworthy.

## Localisation

An information website might want to publish articles in more than one language.
In such case, it **can** create sub-sources, each of which handling the
publication of its articles in one language. A source, regardless of whether it
is a sub-source or not, **must not** publish articles in more than one language.

A sub-source is an entity similar to a source, with the exception that it
**must** be related to a source. Each sub-source **must** be a registered Matrix
user, and **must** register itself on the Matrix room through the publication of
a state event of the `network.informo.subsource` type, with the Matrix user's ID
as the event's state key. The event's content **must** be embedded in a [signed
Matrix event](/information-distribution/signature/#signed-matrix-event), signed
by one of the parent source's public keys, with its `signed` object using the
following model:

|      Parameter      |    Type    | Req. |                                  Description                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------- | :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sig_algo`          | `string`   |  x   | Algorithm the sub-source will use to cryptographically sign its articles. ðŸ”§    |
| `sig_keys`          | `[string]` |  x   | Public keys the sub-source will use to cryptographically sign its articles. ðŸ”§  |
| `website`           | `string`   |      | URL of the source's website in this language, if there's one.                  |
| `description`       | `string`   |      | Short localised description of the source and its publications.                |
| `custom`            | `object`   |      | Additional information for custom client implementations.                      |

The parent source **must** then reference the sub-source in its own registration
event, as a `lang` object. A `lang` object **can** reference the source that
emitted the `network.informo.source` event, but a Matrix user ID **must not** be
referenced more than once in a source registration's whole array of `lang`
objects.

{{% notice info %}}
If a source decides to register itself as one if its own sub-sources, it doesn't
need to emit any `network.informo.subsource` event for this specific sub-source.
The articles published by the source acting as one of its sub-sources **must**
then be signed using the one of the source's public keys.

### Example

Considering the example of an example website publishing news
only in English, and registering itself as a source with the Matrix user id
`@acmenews:example.com`, and not registering any sub-source, the array of `lang`
objects would look like this:

```
[
    {
        "locale": "en",
        "mxid": "@acmenews:example.com"
    }
]
```

## Full example

Let's consider a news website, named "ACME News", publishing news in both
English and French, each on a localised website. We'll also consider
`@acmenews:example.com` its main Informo source, and `@acmenewsen:example.com`
and `@acmenewsfr:example.com` its sub-sources, handling the publications of
articles, respectively in English and in French.

Here are the state events it needs to emit to properly register all of its
sources.

Please keep in mind that, although this can look like a troublesome thing to do,
it can easily be automated using one of the existing [SDKs for
Matrix](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#client-sdks).

start publishing articles in English, and `@acmenewsfr:example.com` can start
publishing articles in French.

English and French, each on a localised website. We'll also consider
`@acmenews:example.com` its main Informo source, and `@acmenewsfr:example.com`
its sub-sources, handling the publications of articles in French. The publication of articles in English is done by ACME News's main source, `@acmenews:example.com`

Here are the state events it needs to emit to properly register all of its
