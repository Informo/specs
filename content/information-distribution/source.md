A source is an entity holding the responsibility of publishing information
through the Matrix room. Each source **must** be a registered Matrix user, and a
Matrix user **must not** register more than one source, which means there is a
one to one correspondence between a source and its Matrix user.

A source **must** register itself as such on the room. This **must** be done
through the publication of a `network.informo.source` state event. The event's
state key **must** be the ID of the source's Matrix user. The content of this
event **must** be provided using the following model:

## Matrix event `network.informo.source`

|      Parameter      |        Type       | Req. |                                                              Description                                                            |

| `sig_keys`          | `[string]`        |  x   | Public keys the source will use to cryptographically sign its articles. üîß                                                           |
| `website`           | `string`          |      | URL of the source's website, if there's one.                                                                                        |

| `country`           | `string`          |      | Country of the source's owner. If provided, **must** be compliant with [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html). |
| `custom`            | `object`          |      | Additional information for custom client implementations.                                                                           |

 <!-- üîß: Need to do some research on Megolm and Matrix APIs around encryption
 and key management -->

Where:

<!--
   The definition of `localisedString` here is the same as in
   trust-authority.md. People changing it might want to also change it there (or
   remove this warning).
-->
* `localisedString` is a map associating a [RFC
  5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646)-compliant language (and variant)
  identifier to a localisation of the string in the language the identifier
  refers to.
* `lang` is a map associating a [RFC
  5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646)-compliant language (and variant)
  identifier to the Matrix user ID of the sub-source that handles the
  publication of articles in this language (and variant). This map **must**
  contain at least one element. More information on localised sub-sources and
  examples are available [below](#localisation).

Each time one of the source's properties changes, it **must** publish a new
registration event, and every trust authority certifying the trustworthiness of
this source **must** generate a new signature from the new event. This signature
lives in a TA's registration event üìù.

If a source doesn't provide a logo, client implementations **can** use the
[avatar](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html#get-matrix-client-r0-profile-userid-avatar-url)
of its Matrix user instead.

## Compromission of cryptographic private keys

Every trust authority certifying a source's trustworthiness **must** be operated
by an organism or individual the source trusts and is in contact with outside of
Informo. If at least one of a source's private keys gets compromised, the source
**must** update its list of public signature verification keys by publishing a
new registration event containing the updated list, and every trust authority
trusting the source **must** compute and issue a new signature taking the
updated list of keys into account. The reason behind this is to encourage trust
authorities to communicate with their trusted sources, estimate how much
compromised the source is (i.e. one key vs all of the keys vs the source's
entire Matrix account), and take the actions it deems necessary.

In such an event, client implementations **should** consider articles posted
prior to the key being declared as compromised as probably not having been
tampered with, with no way to be 100% sure about it.

## Localisation

An information website might want to publish articles in more than one language.
In such case, it **can** create sub-sources, each of which handling the
publication of its articles in one language. A source, regardless of whether it
is a sub-source or not, **must not** publish articles in more than one language.

A sub-source is an entity similar to a source, with the exception that it
**must** be referenced to by a source. Each sub-source **must** be a registered
Matrix user, and **must** register itself on the Matrix room through the
publication of a `network.informo.subsource` state event, with the Matrix user's
ID as the event's state key. The event's content **must** be embedded in a
[signed Matrix event](/information-distribution/signature/#signed-matrix-event),
signed by one of the parent source's public keys, with its `signed` object using
the following model:

### Matrix event `network.informo.subsource`

|      Parameter      |    Type    | Req. |                                  Description                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------- | :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `parent`            | `string`   |  x   | Matrix user ID of the sub-source's parent.                                     |
| `sig_algo`          | `string`   |  x   | Algorithm the sub-source will use to cryptographically sign its articles. üîß    |
| `sig_keys`          | `[string]` |  x   | Public keys the sub-source will use to cryptographically sign its articles. üîß  |
| `website`           | `string`   |      | URL of the source's website in this language, if there's one.                  |
| `description`       | `string`   |      | Short localised description of the source and its publications.                |
| `custom`            | `object`   |      | Additional information for custom client implementations.                      |

The parent source **must** then reference the sub-source in its own registration
event, as a `lang` object. The `lang` object **can** reference the source that
emitted the `network.informo.source` event, but a Matrix user ID **must not** be
referenced more than once in a source registration's `lang` object.

{{% notice info %}}
A source **can** register itself as one if its own sub-sources. In this case, it
doesn't need to emit any `network.informo.subsource` event for this specific
sub-source. The articles published by the source acting as one of its
sub-sources **must** be signed using one of the source's public keys.
{{% /notice %}}

If set, client implementations **must** use the value for the `description` and
`website` keys of the `network.informo.subsource` event instead of the localised
description and the website provided in the parent source's
`network.informo.source` event.

Client implementations **must** consider a sub-source as holding the same [trust
level](/trust-management/trust-level) as its parent source, and therefore
**must** consider it at the same location in trust networks as its parent.

### Example

Let's consider the example of an example website publishing news only in
English, and registering itself as a source with the Matrix user id
`@acmenews:example.com`, and not registering any sub-source, the `lang` object
would look like this:

```
{
    "en": "@acmenews:example.com"
}
```

{{% notice tip %}}
In this example, `en-US`, `en-GB`, etc. can be used instead of `en` if the
source wants to explicitely specify language variants.
{{% /notice %}}

## Client implementations behaviours regarding sources

Client implementations **should** allow users to subscribe to all of the
articles published by a specific source.

client implementations **can** display a source and all of its sub-sources as a
single entity with several languages available.

client implementations **should** allow users to set at least one preferred
language and use it to select the corresponding name and description for sources
that offer a name or a description in this language. If a source doesn't offer
either a name or a description in the user's preferred language, client
implementations **can** select another language to fall back to, by allowing the
user to set a weighted list of preferred languages. If a source only provide its
name or description in one language, client implementations **must** use that
value.

## Full example

Let's consider a news website, named "ACME News", publishing news in both
English and French, each on a localised website. We'll also consider
`@acmenews:example.com` its main Informo source, and `@acmenewsen:example.com`
and `@acmenewsfr:example.com` its sub-sources, handling the publication of
articles, respectively in English and in French.

Here are the state events it needs to emit to properly register all of its
sources.

{{% notice note %}}
Please keep in mind that, although this can look like a troublesome thing to do,
it can easily be automated using one of the existing [SDKs for
Matrix](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html#client-sdks).

## Alternate example

Let's consider a news website, named "ACME News", publishing news in both
English and French, each on a localised website. We'll also consider
`@acmenews:example.com` its main Informo source, and `@acmenewsfr:example.com`
its sub-source handling the publications of articles in French. The
publication of articles in English is done by ACME News's main source,
`@acmenews:example.com`.

Here are the state events it needs to emit to properly register all of its
sources.

Once both of these events have been published, `@acmenews:example.com` can
start publishing articles in English, and `@acmenewsfr:example.com` can start
